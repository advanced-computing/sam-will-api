## Instructions
***User Instructions***: 
    1. Enter "duckdb Fed_CPI2.db" into the terminal\n
    2. Enter ".tables" to see the three table titles cpi_append, cpi_inc, cpi_trunc\n
    3. Enter "SELECT * FROM cpi_append;" to see the append table\n
    4. Enter "SELECT * FROM cpi_inc;" to see the inc table\n
    5. Enter "SELECT * FROM cpi_trunc;" to see the trunc table

***Explanation***:
    cpi_trunc will look identical to PCPI25.csv, and so will cpi_inc. However, cpi_append will look different
